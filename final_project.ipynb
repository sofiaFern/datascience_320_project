    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Science has always been a generally male-dominated career, with only eighteen percent of all computer scientists being women. Technica is the world's largest all-women and nonbinary hackathon, hosted annually at the University of Maryland. Since its inception in 2015, Technica has been putting a spotlight on women in the computer science workplace and empowering them to succeed. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Over the course of this 24 hour hackathon, women and non-binary people experience the very best of tech culture and are encouraged to think out of the box and develop immersive and amazing projects.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to look at the overall reach of Technica as a whole, and understand the demographics of the attendees using data collected in 2018 including:\n",
